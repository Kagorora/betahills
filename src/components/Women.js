                <p>In recent years, Rwanda has become well-known for championing women’s empowerment and advancing gender equality. Together with GIZ, Rwanda launched an education program to train women for jobs in tech. Once they have successfully completed the program, participants receive ISTQB® certification and are hired by Muraho Technology, a Rwandan software testing company that partners with Betahills. By delivering world-class service on the international market, Muraho is key player in Rwanda’s transition into a tech hub. And by connecting the team at Muraho with European clients, Betahills is helping to empower women to pursue careers in Kigali’s booming IT and technology sector.</p>
